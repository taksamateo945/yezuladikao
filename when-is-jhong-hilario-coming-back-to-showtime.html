What Was the Reason for Jhong Hilario’s Departure from Showtime? The question of whether he has returned has piqued people’s interest. In this post, you’ll learn more about Jhong.</strong></p><p>Jhong Hilario is a politician, actor, dancer, and television host from the Philippines. He is a member of the Street Boys, a Filipino dancing group.</p><p>He has been a Makati councilor from the <a href=#>1st district since 2016</a>. Two of his most well-known television antagonist performances are Gary David in the 2010 adaptation of Mara Clara and Homer “Alakdan” Adlawan in FPJ’s Ang Probinsyano.</p><p>He is currently a regular host of ABS-Showtime, ‘CBN’s It’s a noontime variety show.’ In 2016, Hilario opted to run for city councilor in Makati’s 1st district under the United Nationalist Alliance and Abby Binay’s ticket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.mixedarticle.com/uploads/2022/6/15b11aba-2fbd-4138-93ff-b8709581568c.webp><h2 id=why-did-jhong-hilario-leave-showtime>Why Did Jhong Hilario Leave Showtime?</h2><p><span>Even though Jhong did not explain why he was leaving the show on television, he had announced his intention to run for public office in October 2015.</span></p><p>In an interview with PUSH, the presenter disclosed that he would run for Makati City councilor, following in the footsteps of his father, Virgilio Hilario, who is about to finish his term as councilor.</p><p>Jhong said he wishes to carry on his father’s work, which included 18 years as a Barangay Captain and nine years as a Makati Councilor.</p><p>His father is a strong United Nationalist Alliance supporter (UNA). As a result, Jhong will run under the UNA banner, which is led by Vice President Jejomar Binay.</p><h2 id=where-is-jhong-hilario-now-and-has-he-returned-to-the-show>Where Is Jhong Hilario Now And Has He Returned To The Show?</h2><p>Jhong Hilario shocked the hosts with his return to the show during the Tawag ng Tanghalan portion of Its Showtime earlier today, June 4.</p><p>He introduced himself as Friedrich Palacol, a fully disguised contender so that no one would know him. Along with the other contenders, he sang “Kahit Maputi na ang Buhok Ko.”</p><p>On the other hand, the hosts and judges began to think that one of the participants was singing out of rhythm with the others.</p><p>Jhong gradually removed his mask, surprising his co-hosts. Vice Ganda couldn’t help but be moved by Jhong’s return to the studio.</p><p>Vhong Navarro then asked Jhong if he would be returning to the show permanently. On a more serious note, Jhong stated that he would return immediately after taking his oath.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2Bepl2ewG62x6iloGWYnrmivsioZJynnZ67qHnBmpqkZaSkerS0zrCroqWVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./todrick-hall-sued-for-60k-in-owed-rent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Todrick Hall Sued For $60k In Owed Rent</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-jess-hilarious-and-boyfriend-daniel-parsons-getting-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Jess Hilarious and Boyfriend Daniel Parsons Getting Married?
