This is a well-deserved win. I tell people to look at what a person have done, not what they say they are going to do. Keep up the good work. We all are proud of you.”</p><p>A second supporter stated: “You were absolutely FLAWLESS. Confident, elegant and beautiful. So proud of you and my heart was beaming as you graced that National stage. Love you.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw-6GM0DQMj/</p><p>A third person added: “Like y’ all do realize this is one of the best moments of this woman’s life and you’re hurling hate at her? How about be decent human beings for a moment & think about how you treat other people?”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What are your thoughts on the new Miss USA?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnbK0uMieZKSqqajBbsPIp6pmpZmowG7B0ppkmqaUYrOiutJmmKmonJbCpXnBnpiurKlisLC6056qrWWWpL9uss6crKyhnpx6rrvRnmSopl2WsKS7zKmjoquYorKvwNJmoKerpJqupXnOn2SjraOpeq27zqSqZmpnbYNzfY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10119985-free-agents-browns-should-pursue-after-2024-nfl-draft.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Free Agents Browns Should Pursue After 2024 NFL Draft | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shows-similar-to-black-cake.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shows Like Black Cake: Unraveling More Dark and Twisted Tales</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
