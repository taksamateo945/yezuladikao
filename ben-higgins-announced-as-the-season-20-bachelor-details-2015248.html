While the Denver native was the obvious front-runner for the role from the moment of his elimination, he was slightly more reserved about the possibility of being The Bachelor this past summer.</p><p>“I don’t know, that’s not really for me right now,” the dimpled reality star, 27, told <strong>Us Weekly </strong>at the Men Tell All taping in June. “I want to wait until [the offer] is on the table, because I want to focus on the life I had. I’m not extremely comfortable with the attention. That is something I have to figure out. Right now, I just want to go back to the life I had.”</p><p>As previously reported by <strong>Us,</strong> Higgins subsequently turned down a work promotion and put the breaks on a possible romance with Season 14 Bachelor contestant <strong>Tenley Molzahn.</strong></p><p>Higgins also told <strong>Us </strong>in June that he was weighing the pros and cons before signing on to be the Bachelor. “I think it’s a great opportunity,” he said at the time. “I think it’s something that any man, if asked, should consider. And I’ve been in the process now and I can see that it works.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Prior to the announcement, producers mulled over the idea of having both <strong>Ben H.</strong> and <strong>Ben Zorn</strong>, another suitor from Bristowe’s season, vie as The Bachelor. One source told <strong>Us </strong>that if both Bens were chosen, producers would call the season <a href=#>“The Bachelor: All About The Benjamins.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ultimately, it became singular as Ben H. had the unprecedented support of Bachelor Nation, including Harrison, his fellow suitors, and Bachelorettes — past and present. “I think girls would totally swoon for him,” Season 10 Bachelorette<strong> Andi Dorfman</strong> told <strong>Us</strong> recently. “I think he just seems like a guy with good values and good morals and somebody that’s very pure.”</p><p>Like Dorfman, Bristowe also endorsed Higgins. “I say to everybody. Every girl. Every man. Every dog. Everyone out there would agree with me right now that Ben H. is the man,” Bristowe told Us at the Men Tell All taping. Her fiancé was equally enthusiastic about Higgins becoming the next Bachelor.</p><p>“He’d make the perfect Bachelor,” Booth told<strong> Us</strong> in a conference call. “He deserves nothing but the best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOm5ynZZietKi1zaxkmqaepMKvr8SdZJqrXam1pnnSnpisp55if3F5wZqaoZ2cpL9usMStmKKko2J%2FcX2Ua2tx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eminem-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eminem Net Worth: How the Rap Legend Built His Fortune</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./97696-mzansi-cant-deal-with-clip-fikile-mbalula-trying-blow-sparklers-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mzansi Can't Deal With Clip of Fikile Mbalula Trying to Blow Sparklers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
