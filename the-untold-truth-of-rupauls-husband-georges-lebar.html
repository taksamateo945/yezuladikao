The couple has been together for more than 25 years, but didn’t officially marry until 2017.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_educational_background_and_family>Early life, educational background and family</span></h2><p>Georges LeBar was born on 24 January 1973, in Perth, Western Australia, so holds Australian nationality. He spent his childhood in Australia, and his parents still live there. Georges is in good relationship with his mother, and she is also a big friend of Georges’ spouse, RuPaul. Since his childhood Georges has been interested in fine arts, and did a lot of painting – his parents supported his passions. He matriculated from his local Australian high school in 1991, and then, according to his <a rel=nofollow href=#>own words</a>, studied fashion and design in New York, Paris and Miami.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Georges LeBar is a painter; his works from 2006 to 2007 have been published in two books, “Six Inches Away” and “Pillowtalk”, representing the collection of his oil paintings. All his artworks can be seen on his personal website georgeslebar.com.</p><p>He is also the owner of a ranch in Wyoming, as large as 60,000 acres (approximately 242,000 square meters) which he inherited from his American grandmother, and where he spends most of his time when he is not accompanying his spouse on his trips around the world.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life_spouse_RuPaul_Andre_Charles>Personal life, spouse RuPaul Andre Charles</span></h2><p>Georges met RuPaul for the first time in 1994, in the club called “The Limelight”, located in New York City, when Georges was celebrating his birthday with friends. They instantly felt the attraction for each other –&nbsp; ‘I met him on a Monday 25 years ago. One week later, we were on Elton John’s private jet flying from London to Düsseldorf’ – RuPaul <a rel=nofollow href=#>shared</a> the story of the beginning of their relationship on his Instagram account. (He is the only one talking publicly about their relationship – Georges always keeps silent.)</p><p>In his interview for Vogue Magazine in 2019, RuPaul said that their marriage is open, as even though they were officially married, he didn’t want to put any shackles on Georges: ‘Love is free. It’s not that sort of romantic surface thing we all bought into. He is my most favorite person that I’ve met. Besides, Gore Vidal said you should never pass up an opportunity to have sex or be on television’, said RuPaul. The couple doesn’t have any kids, and RuPaul admitted he liked the quiet and peace, so Georges and RuPaul <a rel=nofollow href=#>are not even planning</a> to have kids ever. The couple kept in secret the fact of their official marriage, and RuPaul dropped they were married only in 2017. The ceremony was very private, and only their closest friends were invited to share the celebration.</p><h3><span id=Who_is_RuPaul>Who is RuPaul?</span></h3><p>RuPaul Andre Charles was born on 17 November 1960, in San Diego, California USA, however, soon after his birth, his family moved to Atlanta, Georgia.

He subsequently released seven more albums, including “Born Naked” (2014), “Slay Belles” (2016) and “Butch Queen” (2017).
