Her death came almost six months after she was found — in circumstances eerily similar to her mother's death —&nbsp;unconscious in her bathtub on Saturday, Jan. 31, by her longtime partner&nbsp;<strong>Nick Gordon</strong>. Bobbi Kristina was placed in hospice care on Wednesday, June 24, after months of treatment in a medically induced coma. She was surrounded by family and friends at the time of her death.</p><p>Bobbi Kristina's family has remained by her side throughout the ordeal.&nbsp;After spending over two weeks in a coma, doctors performed a tracheotomy in February, to help stave off infection from her breathing tube while she continued to fight for her life.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bobbi Kristina Brown passed away July, 26 2015, surrounded by her family," the Houston family tells&nbsp;Us Weekly in a statement. "She is finally at peace in the arms of God. We want to again thank everyone for their tremendous amount of love and support during these last few months."</p><p>As previously reported, police confirmed to Us that the entire case surrounding her death is being treated as a criminal investigation following unexplained markings on her body. Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, was questioned in regard to the circumstances surrounding her death. He also appeared on Dr. Phil in March, where his interview was quickly turned into an intervention after Gordon was clearly slurring his words and threatening his own life. He entered rehab soon after and left in April.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in 1993, Bobbi Kristina was the only child of the late Houston and Brown. The couple had a tumultuous 14-year marriage, tarnished by rumors of infidelity, drug use, and domestic violence. In a 2002 interview with <strong>Diane Sawyer</strong>, Houston famously declared, "Crack is whack," adding she'd never do crack because it's "too cheap." The family appeared on the widely criticized 2005 reality show Being Bobby Brown. Houston filed for divorce in 2006 and in 2007 it was finalized. The "I Will Always Love You" singer — who won seven Grammys and sold more than 200 million albums in her storied career — was awarded custody of their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>The shocking loss comes more than three years after Houston herself died at age 48 in the bathtub of her Beverly Hilton hotel room on Feb. 11, 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Less than a month after her Houston's death, Bobbi Kristina spoke with <strong><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> about losing her mother, saying, "It comes in waves. One minute I could be laughing and happy, but then it will come over me. It's my mom. I start crying, but then I hear her again, saying, 'Come on, keep moving.'"</p><p>Bobbi Kristina expressed her desire to become a singer like her world-famous parents on the Lifetime reality show&nbsp;The Houstons: On Our Own, which aired for one season in late 2012.</p><p>Days before Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub, an insider tells <strong>Us Weekly</strong> that she got into a fight with her longtime love Gordon, whom Houston informally adopted when he was a teen.&nbsp;</p><p>The unconventional relationship, which Bobbi Kristina referred to as a marriage, was a controversial subject within the Houston family. Bobby Brown's lawyer Christopher Brown released a statement on Feb. 3, saying,&nbsp;"To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon." As a result of the controversial relationship, Bobbi was estranged from her father in recent years, a source tells Us.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The fight with Gordon led her to a darker place, according to sources. “She was depressed and very upset,” the insider explains. “Whitney’s death hit her harder than anyone will ever know.”</p><p>Following her hospitalization, Gordon was not allowed to visit the star. In a February statement to Us, Gordon’s lawyers expressed he had adamantly tried to be by her side. “Nick has been trying, privately, to do everything he can to see Bobbi Kristina cooperatively,” his lawyers told <strong>Us.</strong> “He has respected the family’s wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation. But he desperately wants to be with the one he loves and continues to hope that his request will be granted.”</p><p>The investigation surrounding her death is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmompKeeqy%2ByKyroqaRYq%2Bzu9anZJ2dkZl6c36Mmp2tnaJiurC606GqZqyimq61ucSnq2ZqYGaCc4KW</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./which-peaky-blinder-brother-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Which peaky Blinder brother died?
