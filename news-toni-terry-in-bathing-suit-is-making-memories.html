The wife of soccer star John Terry shows off her incredible figure in a swimsuit while vacationing in the UAE with her husband and children. "Making memories with my beautiful family in Dubai," she captioned the series of Instagram snaps. How does she stay so fit? Read on to see 5 of Toni Terry's top tips for staying in shape and the photos that prove they work‚Äîand to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Toni explained to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Sun</span></a><span> that her fitness journey started with the help of her husband. "Everyone else seemed to look amazing but I hated all the pictures I saw of me. Perhaps I should have been easier on myself ‚Äî I had just had twins, after all ‚Äî but this was the slightly insane world I lived in and the ¬≠pressure was immense," she said about her body images struggles postpartum. "That was the trigger for me to change my body for ever. With the support of John, both of us are very happy indeed."</span></p><p><span>Toni is such a fan of workout buddies that she wrote an entire book about it called The Buddy Workout. "It's taken me a long time to figure out what actually works for me. I've tried all sorts of diet and exercise programmes, the winning formula for me was when my husband John invited a personal trainer over and we started training together as a whole family with the kids and then my friends started to get involved," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Female First</span></a><span>. "Come rain or shine we get out, pushing ourselves, always laughing and encouraging each other. We all have different shapes and sizes and fitness abilities. It was great to hit on a workout I loved, see my body changing, and get to spend time with my buddies."</span></p><p><span>Toni is a big fan of weight and strength training. "Saturday morning sessions," she captioned one of her workout photos. "Glute session this morning üçë 1 minute each exercise with 30 seconds rest in between. Do 3 sets," she captioned </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>another</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Toni enjoys riding horses, both for the physical and mental health benefits. "I've always worked and I feel strongly about having my own career. That only ended when I fell pregnant. I've tried to avoid the spotlight. I am exceptionally proud of John ‚Äì what he has achieved since he was 17 is amazing," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Mirror</span></a><span>. "But now the children are more grown up I can exert myself a bit. Before I felt I was John's wife and a mum first and foremost. Now I think I have something to say ‚Äì especially about the equestrian world. My aim is to get to the top levels of dressage. I don't just want to be known as John's wife but also as a working mum."</span></p><p><span>Toni also has a winter sport she loves: Skiing. She regularly hits the slopes with her family, and has an entire Instagram tab filled with photos and videos of their runs. "Spending time with family is my favourite thing to do! Especially on the slopes," she captioned one of her skiing posts.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkraeennq1sdGrsGahnmKvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV5yKxkppmbnruoecyepKiqmZrAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dominick-cruz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dominick Cruz- Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kendall-jenner-rocks-leather-pants-while-leaving-boyfriend-devin-bookers-basketball-game-in-l-a.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Kendall Jenner Rocks Leather Pants While Leaving Boyfriend Devin Booker's Basketball Game in L.A.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
