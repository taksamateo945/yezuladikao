The pair dated for five years before they broke up, citing irreconcilable differences. Owen is a<a href=#> renowned actor</a>, while Varunie is a businesswoman. From his previous relationships, the actor has two sons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/feca761062f57b85.jpg><p class=align-left>His<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> oldest son</a> is Robert Ford Wilson, born in 2011 to his ex-girlfriend Jade Duell. Owen’s second son, Finn Lindqvist, was born in 2014 to his trainer, Carolina Lindqvist.</p><h3>Lyla Aranya Wilson's age</h3><p class=align-left>Born on October 9, 2018, in the United States, the<a href=#> celebrity kid </a>is four years old as of 2022. She is around 3 feet and 8 inches tall, and her zodiac sign is Libra. She is a white American in terms of national and racial origins.</p><h2>Lyla’s physical appearance</h2><p class=align-left>The celebrity kid is the <a id=https://yachol.com/lyla-aranya-wilson/ href=#>spitting image</a> of her father. She has her father’s complexion, blue eyes, white skin and blonde hair. Most <a href=#>people</a> admire her innocent demeanour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/6df93f57f8a0918d.jpg><h2>What did Owen Wilson do to his daughter?</h2><p class=align-left>When Varunie was pregnant in 2018, Owen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">voluntarily took</a> a DNA test to ascertain the child’s paternity, proving him as the child’s biological father. In June, the actor checked the no visitation box in <a href=#>court</a>, and the comedian was absent during her daughter’s childbirth. His actions leave most of his fans asking, “Is Owen Wilson a good father?”</p><h2>Did Owen Wilson ever meet his daughter?</h2><p class=align-left>Owen and Varunie ended their relationship while she was pregnant. The comedian has never met his 4-year-old daughter. However, allegedly<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> he pays </a>$25,000 monthly in child support for Lyla. Owen also made a one-off payment of $70,000 to Varunie to cover things like a labour coach, a nurse and her legal fees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/fc3f024b52d00426.jpg><p class=align-left>In November 2019, Vongsvirate told the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail </a>that the actor was not involved in his daughter’s life. She openly expressed that it was ironic that the actor plays fatherly roles in films but could not be there in her daughter’s life. To date, Wilson shows no interest in his daughter.</p><p class=align-left>Although Lyla Aranya Wilson has a celebrity parent, her mother prefers to maintain a private life and keep some details about her from the public eye. As much as they do not share a close father-daughter relationship, this might change. Aranya is still a child with her whole life ahead of her.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Owen Wilson's net worth, age, children, partner, movies and TV shows, profiles</a></p><p class=align-left><strong>We </strong>published an article about Owen Wilson. His net worth as of 2022 shows that the actor and movie producer enjoys more than the luxurious lifestyle that the average American can boast of. He has worked himself and is still working to the bone since his debut movie role in 1999.</p><p class=align-left>It has been over two decades of consistent features in television and movie roles for the blonde actor who recently co-starred in the movie, <i>Marry Me</i> alongside A-list celebrity Jeniffer Lopez. The actor and screenwriter was born in Dallas, Texas, the USA, on 18th November 1968. Wilson's age is 53 years, but he will be celebrating his 54th birthday before the end of 2022.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKetwq2qZqSZm7KprcKkqmiblaGyo77IraCeq12XtrCz0ZqnoaGVqHxygJhtaGtllJ6xbrvWnqVmr5mhwLC6jKacnqxdma62s8etnKtlnK65onnAq5insZFixKq40qilaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chicago-auto-show-means-return-to-business-for-mccormick-place.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chicago Auto Show means return to business for McCormick Place</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cynthia-frelund-wiki-bio-age-height-shoe-size-salary-is-she-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cynthia Frelund Wiki Bio, age, height, shoe size, salary.
