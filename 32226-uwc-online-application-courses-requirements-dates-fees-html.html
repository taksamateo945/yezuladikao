When embarking on the UWC 2022 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">online application,</a> it is essential that you, first of all, have an understanding of the processes that are involved in it. Therefore, the following steps are what you should follow when you want to apply online at the UWC student portal:</p><h3>Step 1 – Fill out the online application form</h3><p class=align-left>For you to be able to access the UWC application form, the first thing that you need to do is to visit the official portal of the university to get started. Once you are there, choose the "New application" option, and you will be redirected.</p><p class=align-left>Note that while doing this, you should have concluded the kind of programme that you want to apply for. This is because the institution grants the opportunity to only apply for a maximum of two programmes.</p><h3>Step 2 - Wait for an acknowledgement letter</h3><p class=align-left>The moment you successfully fill out the application form, a message from the university will be sent to you through the email address you provided while filling out the form. This is to acknowledge the receipt of your application.</p><p class=align-left>Note that in the acknowledgement letter, your application number would be included in it, which you need to keep. The essence is that in every communication you make with the university, you will need to use the applicant number.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from the application number, you would also be served with a brochure that indicates the supporting documents which you would be required to submit to the university if you want your application to be considered.</p><h3>Step 3 – Upload the necessary documents</h3><p class=align-left>Once you have all the documents that are required available, the next thing that you need to do is to visit the university's official website again to upload the required documents. Again, you will need your application number and identification or passport number.</p><p class=align-left>However, remember that if you are a current matriculant, you do not have to upload any documentation. But if you have enrolled already, you will need to upload your foreign school-leaving certificate/matric certificate.</p><p class=align-left>Also, if you are attending a different <a href=#>higher institution,</a> a certificate of good conduct stamped by your institution's registrar and a certified copy of your academic record would be needed for upload.</p><p class=align-left>All University of the Western Cape application forms are expected to be submitted before September 30, 2022. However, selected post-graduate programmes will close earlier. While applying, it is interesting to note that you do not have to pay any UWC application fee.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, after you have applied, you need to monitor your UWC application status. This is because, usually, you are expected to get feedback from the institution some days after the application closing date. So, if you do not hear from them, you can monitor your UWC application status in 2022 by visiting their official website.</p><h2>UWC admission requirements</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/90621cc171b5e780.jpg><p class=align-left>Depending on the programme you are pursuing, there are peculiar UWC requirements that each category of the applicants needs to understand and follow if their applications will be considered.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, whether you are applying for a bachelor's degree, diploma or higher certificate, you need to meet the following requirements before you start to apply to the University of the Western Cape.</p><h3>For the bachelor's degree</h3><p class=align-left>Below are the requirements for a bachelor's degree.</p><ul><li>National Senior Certificate (NSC).</li><li>An achievement rating of 4 (Adequate achievement, 50-59%).</li><li>Alternatively, four subjects are chosen from the recognised 20-credit NSC subjects, also known as the 'designated subject list'.
