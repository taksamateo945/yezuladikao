It is also known that she chose to stay by his side through his struggles despite calls from the public for her to end her marriage to him.</p><p>Her husband, Michael Irvin, is a former pro football player, pro football hall of famer, a former broadcaster for ESPN’s Sunday NFL countdown, and currently works as a sports analyst for the NFL network. His evident struggles with drug addiction are primarily why his wife, Sandy Harell, who has stayed away from the media spotlight, has been cast into the sphere she shunned for years.<br></p><h3><strong>Summary of Sandy Harrell’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Sandy Harrell Irvin</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African-American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Sandy Harrell’s Husband:</strong> Michael Irvin</li><li><strong>Sandy Harrell’s Children:</strong> 4 – Elijah Irvin (son), Chelsea Irvin (daughter), Michael Irvin Jr. (son), and Myesha Beyonca (step-daughter)</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the wife of Pro Football Hall of Famer, Michael Irvin</li></ul><h2><strong>Not Much Is Known About Sarah Harrell’s Early Life And Family Background</strong></h2><p>It is no longer a secret that Sandy Harrell is notoriously secretive when questions about her life, in general, come up for discussion. Were it not because she got hitched to a rather famous spouse, her name would probably still be unknown. Even after her marriage to a celebrity, details about the celebrity wife’s personal affairs are still unknown.</p><p>Not even her date of birth is known to the public. Although judging from her images that are available online, we won’t be too far off the mark by guessing her age to be in the 50s. An argument could also be made for the fact that her husband, who was born on March 5, 1966, and is currently 56 years old, doesn’t appear to be much older than her if we go by media images of the couple together.</p><p>We can only speculate, although there is still no conclusive evidence of her age. Regarding her nationality, it is a guarantee to say that she is an American citizen, if not for anything else, for her current marriage to someone who is.&nbsp;In the same vein, there are no records about Sandy’s birth family, including the identity of her parents or any siblings.</p><p>However, her photos that are available online clearly make her out as being from an African-American ethnic background.&nbsp;Sandy Harrell’s formal educational background is another aspect of her life that she has inadvertently left open to media debate and public speculation.</p><p>Even though she seems to be an adequately educated woman, there are no records to show where she acquired her formal education beginning from pre-school, middle school, high school, and college/university.</p><h2><strong>Sandy Harrell Became Michael Irvin’s Wife in the Early ’90s</strong></h2><p>On June 23, 1990, Sandy Harrell and Michael Irvin exchanged marital vows to become a married couple officially. Details of exactly how they met or how long they dated before they tied the knot are things the couple apparently prefer to keep to themselves. However, one important fact of their relationship was that Michael was still a player in the NFL when Sandy married him.</p><p>The 15th of 17 children born to his parents, Michael was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His formal education took him to the University of Miami, where he honed his exceptional football talents before he was called up to the NFL. Sandy Harrell’s husband spent around 12 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before his career was cut short by a spinal cord injury.</p><p>His career highlights include three SuperBowl victories with the Cowboys. His exceptional career was also recognized by the NFL as he was inducted into the pro-Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Before the NFL recognition, Irvin’s alma mater had shown the NFL the way by inducting him into the institution’s Sports Hall of Fame.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/Sarah-Harrell.jpg alt="Sarah Harrell" width=681 height=526 sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>At the end of a relatively enviable career in the NFL, Irvin became a sports broadcaster for ESPN’s Sunday NFL countdown, and he currently works as a sports analyst for the NFL network.&nbsp;When one considers that Sandy Harrell’s husband, Michael Irvin, was quite the public figure, it becomes somewhat surprising that the playmaker’s wife has evaded the public’s attention until very recently.</p><p>The simple explanation for this is ultimately down to the fact that Sandy Harrell prefers to keep a very low profile which is in direct contrast to her husband’s more public profile. This system worked for the couple as Sandy’s husband had no issue with her choice and eventual decision.</p><h3><strong>Sandy Harrell Chose To Stay With Her Husband Amidst The Various Controversies</strong></h3><p>Sandy Harrell’s marriage might have lasted for 30 years, but it hasn’t been without its challenges. These challenges have been primarily of Michael Irvin’s making. One instance of the scandals that trailed Sandy’s marriage to Irvin happened in 1996 when the then NFL star was caught with cocaine and strippers. He was promptly arrested for this violation.</p><p>After that ordeal, he publicly stated he had struggled with substance abuse, including but not limited to cocaine addiction. This confession cum declaration was met with harsh criticisms and unavoidably drew Sandy into the conversation. She was summarily advised to walk away from her marriage, but she decided to remain in the marriage and weather the storm as a couple.</p><p>Over the years, Sandy’s marriage has come under threat and exposed to all manner of rather unfair criticisms all because of Irvin’s alleged indiscretions, which include but are not limited to rape accusations and drug-related charges. Sandy has stayed beside her husband through all these, constantly rejecting thoughts of divorce because she loves her husband.</p><p>With the worst of the storm behind them and to prove her eternal love and fidelity to Michael, she even gave him a car, a Bentley Mulsanne, in 2016 as a gift for his 50th birthday.</p><h3><strong>Sandy Harrell Has Three Children With Michael Irvin</strong></h3><p>Sandy Harrell’s nearly 32-year marriage to Michael Irvin has produced three children. She had her first child with Michael on May 8, 1997 – a son they named Michael Irvin Jr. The celebrity wife had two more children after the birth of Michael Jr., another son named Elijah Irvin, and a daughter the couple called Chelsa Irvin. Elijah and Chelsea’s exact dates of birth are unknown at the moment.</p><p>Sandy Harrell is also a stepmother to a child from Michael’s previous relationship with Felicia Walker, a daughter named Myesha Beyonca. Michael Jr. and his brother Elijah have continued their father’s legacy by becoming football players. Michael Jr. plays for Florida Atlantic Owls from the tight end position, and Elijah is a running back who played for Prestonwood Christian High School.</p><p>There are no records regarding what Sandy’s daughter and step-daughter are currently up to, probably a case of like mother like daughters.</p><h3><strong>Sandy Harrell Insists on Keeping a Low Profile</strong></h3><p>No one can say what Sandy Harrell does for a living, and therefore, it won’t be easy to point out her net worth. On the other hand, her husband’s well-documented sports career, both as a player and as a sports analyst, has contributed to a rather impressive net worth of over $12 million, the majority of which comes from his playing days.</p><h3><strong>She is Not Active on any Social Media Platform</strong></h3><p>Sandy’s love for her privacy extends to the fact that she currently has no social media handle, including Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook.</p><h2><strong>Fast Facts About Sandy Harrell</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Sandy Harrell Irvin?</strong> Sandy Harrell Irvin is the wife of Dallas Cowboys legend Michael Irvin. the couple have been married for over 30 years and they have 3 children together.</li><li><strong>When did Sandy Harrell and Michael Irvin get married?</strong> Sandy Harrell and Michael Irvin got married in 1990, shortly after Michael was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys.</li><li><strong>Does Sandy Harrell Irvin often appear in public events?</strong> During Michael Irvin’s NFL career, Sandy was often seen cheering for him on the sidelines and attending NFL games, players’ gatherings, and official NFL events.
