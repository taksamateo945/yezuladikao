The former actress from the Philippines shows off her beautiful body in a brown bathing suit in one of her latest social media posts, taking an outdoor shower in paradise. "Self-timer pics," she captioned the set of Instagram snaps. How does she maintain her fit figure? Read on to see 5 of Andi Eigenmann's top diet and fitness tips for staying in shape and the photos that prove they workâ€”and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span>30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Andi stays in fighting physical form with the help of boxing. "Back to boxing with coach </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@theislandboxer</span></a><span>! Lovin' that </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@ilakaisiargao</span></a><span> is right next door and they have an island gym!" she captioned this photo of her boxing session. "This kind of boxing has many health benefits, because it constantly requires you to think, change your position, and change your posture," physical therapist Linda Arslanian, director of rehabilitation services at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's hospital tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>."You're swinging your arms, moving the muscles of your arms and shoulders, increasing your upper-body strength. And when you're in the boxer crouch with a wide stance, with your knees slightly bent, you're strengthening your core muscles, back, and legs."</span></p><p><span>Andi also maintains a healthy diet. "The diet plays a big part in this fitness journey, specially when the goal is to shed some weight. But choosing physical activities and sports to enjoy enough to do regularly is a good tip to be consistent!" she wrote in the same post. "When I challenge myself to achieve something in a specific sport, I get into a mindset of going for it in a holistic way. Most importantly in eating the right nutrient- dense foods that go with the fitness goal!" Some of her favorite foods? Fresh acai bowls, fruit, and smoothies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Andi also surfs. "Just another day in Paradise.ðŸŒ´ literally," she captioned a photo of herself riding the waves. According to the Australian government's </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Better Health</span></a><span>, surfing provides many health benefits including cardiovascular fitness from paddling, shoulder and back strength, which also strengthens from the paddling, and leg and core strength. "Once you're standing up on the board, strong legs and a strong core will keep you up," they say.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Andi also prioritizes hydration. " One of the best ways I do to keep myself healthy from the inside out.âœ¨ i've been making sure to have my </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@aquaflask.ph</span></a><span> filled with water, and always ready in my surf mobile!" she captioned a post of herself with her water bottle. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, hydration is important for a variety of reasons. Water helps get rid of waste through urination, perspiration and bowel movements, keeps your temperature normal, lubricates and cushions joints, and helps protect sensitive tissues.</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Another outdoor activity Andi loves is swimming, which is a good way to get regular aerobic physical activity, according to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>CDC</span></a><span>. Just two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity, such as swimming, bicycling, or running, can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses. In addition to the many physical benefits, there are multiple studies supporting the mental health benefits of swimming as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkmqaUnnqmtcaepaaZnqN6qrqMm5itoJmjtG6%2F1KKrZquYlr%2Bmv4ysnKWeXam2rrHRZqeim6Nk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ju-jingyi-bio-wiki-net-worth-age-height-weight.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ju Jingyi - CelebNetWorth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-rossman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Rossman</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
