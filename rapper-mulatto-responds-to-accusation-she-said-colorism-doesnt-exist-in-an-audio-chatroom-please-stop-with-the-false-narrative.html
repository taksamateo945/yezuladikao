Like, you couldn’t come up with something else, Miss. Lousiana Purchase??”</p><p>The rapper — who is of mixed race — has received criticism in the past for her insensitivity to choosing her stage name. The Spanish word mulatto is derived from the Latin term mulo, meaning mule, which is a hybrid animal born of a horse and a donkey. By the 1500s the Spanish term was used to describe mixed-race offspring of Black and white parentage, and it came into use in America by the Colonial era. Knowing its derogatory history, the “He Said, She Said” rapper defended her name in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>2019</a>, responding to a Twitter user claiming that the 21-year-old’s moniker stopped them from supporting her.</p><p>She wrote, “What’s wrong w Reclaiming a slur & being a voice for a whole culture of people? Little mixed girls come up to me all the time & tell me they relate to my story, and I’m VERY proud of that! Plus, the same ppl who got a problem w my name use N***a in their vocab so.”</p><p>In October, during an interview with Hip Hop Dx at the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>2020 BET Hip-Hop Awards</a>, Mulatto hinted that she might change her controversial stage name to her nickname, Big Latto. “I can’t say too much because we’re working on something right now, but I would be lying to say it hasn’t crossed my mind before,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ohio native also added, “It is a controversy that I hear and see every day as far as my name goes, so I would be lying to say no, I never thought of that. But I can’t say too much because right now because it’s going to be a part of something bigger.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe5BrZmlqX6eusbzEq2SmrZyWwbW7jKucrKifo7G0edOoZJqbk6rAosDIqKVmq5iaerStyJ1knKecpL%2Bqv8xmm6ido6PBbrHXoqqtZZmjeqK6jJqsnaGfYrCprdOrpqilXaW5pq3SnmSsrJ%2Bleri106FkraCVYrOiuNKeZKeZoqeutbXVnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kendall-jenner-rocks-leather-pants-while-leaving-boyfriend-devin-bookers-basketball-game-in-l-a.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kendall Jenner Rocks Leather Pants While Leaving Boyfriend Devin Booker's Basketball Game in L.A.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alfonso-lincoln-ribeiro-jr.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alfonso Lincoln Ribeiro Jr - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
