Why the marriage didn't last a long time is 'cause I didn't take the time to get to know him. I felt peer pressure.<p class=align-left>She was not happy when Christopher did not pursue his career with passion. The actress did not like being the breadwinner and opted for divorce.</p>You know, a woman doesn't like paying all the bills all the time. I can only ask for help so many times before I had to come to the conclusion that I didn't want to be the breadwinner in this family. My mother didn't raise me to take care of a man.
