The Afro-pop duo was born in KwaZulu-Natal province, precisely in Nonoti, which is close to Stanger. Their parents gave birth to them in the year 1997, however, the exact month and date they were born are yet to be publicized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/qq-e1620904661659.jpg><p>Though the sisters are professionally known as Qwabe Twins, their real names are Virginia Qwabe and Viggy Qwabe. They were raised in their hometown of KwaZulu-Natal, where their love for music began when they were still kids. It is not known if the sisters have siblings as they haven’t shared information about their family background or family members with the public.</p><p>The only known family member of theirs is their father. The identity and whereabouts of their mother are still under the radar and it appears they are not in a hurry to disclose her identity or any information relating to her life.</p><p>Virginia and Viggy had their primary and secondary education in their hometown. The names of the academic institutions they attended and the year they graduated from them haven’t been disclosed for public consumption.</p><h2><strong>The Sisters Have A Supportive And Protective Father</strong></h2><p>Laurence Qwabe is the name of the father of the Qwabe Twins. He is reportedly a clergyman who doubles as the founder of the Pure Freedom Christ Church, situated in Nonoti. Not much is known about his personal and family life, including his birth details, origin, relationship with the mother of his children, if he got married to her or not, and life before fame.</p><p>One thing, however, that we do know is that Laurence Qwabe is a supportive and protective dad. He has been there for his girls right from day one. In fact, he didn’t hesitate to give them his blessings the moment they told him about their intention to compete in one of South Africa’s biggest reality shows.</p><p>Mr. Qwabe also invested a huge sum of money in voting for the sisters during their time on the show. After it was alleged that his girls were involved in a fracas during the reality show, he made sure his girls were kept far away from bullies and the media.</p><p>Lawrence apparently has a good father-daughter relationship with his daughters. He is a proud father and someone who is willing to help his daughters get to the top of the ladder in the music industry and become the best version of themselves.</p><h2><strong>The Qwabe Twins Found Fame In The Year 2019</strong></h2><p>The Qwabe twins stormed the South African reality show Idols SA season 15 as individual contestants. It was their first musical outing outside of their hometown KwaZulu-Natal and a big one at that. The sisters began singing in the choir and later started performing at local events around their area. They also used to compose their own songs and perform them along with their friends.</p><p>When the opportunity to showcase their God-given talent on a bigger platform came up, the sisters didn’t hesitate to grab it with both hands. Their performance on the show was indeed outstanding and heart-melting. They literally stole the show after several rounds, winning the hearts of the audience and the praises of the judges.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of them, Virginia, was eliminated from the show and couldn’t make it to the top 10 while Viggy made it. The latter decided to pull out of the show following her sister’s elimination. Her family accused the organizers of the show of rigging the voting process, an allegation they vehemently refuted, insisting that Virginia didn’t get enough votes like her sister.</p><p>There were also reports of the twins getting involved in an altercation on the show. Irrespective of everything that transpired, one thing that never changed was the love the audience had for them. It was massive and really touching. The Qwabe twins have remained a fan favorite since then and are excited about their journey on the famous show.</p><h2><strong>A Look At Their Musical Career Journey So Far</strong></h2><p>The Qwabe twins have had an amazing journey so far. The duo was signed by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>DJ Tira</a> after their outing on Idols SA. They chose Tira over singer Zahara who publicly requested to mentor them. The twins are currently working on some projects following the release of a couple of musical works. Their first song is titled Hamba and it’s been a huge success. They featured DJ Tira in the song which has since gone viral across several platforms.</p><p>The sisters recently released their debut album titled The Gift of Love. The 11-track album was released under DJ Tira’s label, Afrotainment while record producer, dance music maker, and MetroFM Award winner Joocy and the South African Music Awards winner DJ Kent also collaborated with them.</p><p>The Qwabe sisters hope to teach South Africans the need to love and show it to people around through their songs.</p><h2><strong>Are The Qwabe Twins Dating Themselves?</strong></h2><p>The Qwabe twins are known for loving each other passionately as sisters. They always serve siblings’ goals right from their performance days on Idols SA. However, they recently became a subject of discussion on social media after they shared an Instagram video of themselves kissing.</p><p>While some of their fans saw nothing with the act, most people criticized them for crossing the borderline and raising suspicion about their sexuality. Some argued that it was an intimate kiss but the twins came out later to say that they are not in a same-sex relationship, as assumed and speculated.</p><h2><strong>Who Have They Dated In The Past?</strong></h2><p>According to the sisters, none of them is currently in a relationship with any man. Unfortunately, we can’t tell much about their love life before fame because they haven’t opened up about their past.</p><p>Virginia and Viggy are single at the moment and not ready to settle down anytime soon. According to the Qwabe twins, they are looking at a polygamous marriage because they want to remain inseparable.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaKmnlq%2BmedOwoKerXaG2p7GMmqWdZZaWuqq42Gamn2WmnrSoxYyapZ1lpp6%2FqLXNophmrJiaeqmtzJuYZquZo7SmvtJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cynthia-bailey-tries-to-help-porsha-williams-to-stay-strong-on-their-girls-trip-473548.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cynthia Bailey Tries To Help Porsha Williams To Stay Strong On Their Girls Trip</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-hal-auden-cumberbatch-benedict-cumberbatchs-son.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Hal Auden Cumberbatch, Benedict Cumberbatchs Son?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
