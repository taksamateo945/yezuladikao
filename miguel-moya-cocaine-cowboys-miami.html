What happened to him after the drug conspiracy? Where is he now? Why was the jury sequestered?</strong></p><p><a href=#>Cocaine Cowboys: The Kings of Miami</a>, a six-episode documentary series on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, examines how the sunny Florida metropolis has long been filled with shady characters.</p><p>Despite the fact that the spotlight is primarily on <a href=#>Salvador “Sal” Magluta</a> and <a href=#>Augusto “Willy” Falcon</a>, a.k.a. “Los Muchachos,” we also catch a peek into the severe corruption that existed at every level — from law enforcement officers to prosecutors to judges.</p><p><strong>Miguel Moya</strong> is an excellent example of the latter. So, if you’re interested in learning more about this man, we’ve got all the information you’ll need.</p><h2>Cocaine Cowboys: The Kings of Miami – Who is Miguel Moya?</h2><p></p><p><strong>Miguel Moya</strong> was in his early 30s and working as a ramp technician at Miami International Airport from humble beginnings when his life changed forever.</p><p>He obtained a jury summons for Willy and Sal’s federal trial by chance in the mid-1990s, following which the cocaine mobsters’ allies approached and <a href=# rel=noopener>bribed him</a> to turn the trial in their favor.</p><p>Miguel was given approximately <strong>$500,000</strong> in cash in exchange for a <a href=# rel=noopener>hung jury</a>. However, when the opportunity arose, he cleared them by serving as presiding judge and remained firm in his verdict.</p><p>As time progressed, Miguel Moya started indulging in ways he should not have been capable of, given his ordinary profession, putting him under government scrutiny.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>You Might Like: <a href=#>Cocaine Cowboys Miami on Netflix – Jurors Gloria Alba & Maria Penalver were Accused of Taking Bribes!</a></strong></p><p>After all, the failure of Willy and Sal’s case was one of the most devastating ones for the investigators, so they naturally probed every detail later on.</p><p>Miguel not only paid off his creditors and quit using ATMs, but he also purchased a <strong>$171,000</strong> property for his parents, cars, boats, and diamonds, as well as a Rolex, all in cash and in a matter of months. He’d even put <strong>$84,000</strong> in bank accounts and take a trip with the money.</p><h2>Miguel Moya Miami – Where is He Now?</h2><p></p><p>On an unfortunate day in the summer of 1998, <strong>Miguel Moya</strong> was visited in the worker-only parking area at Miami International Airport by a pretty huge and enigmatic man.</p><p>He pretended to be Willy and Sal’s accomplice and began probing about the bribe payment, but Miguel attempted to play dumb.</p><p>Shortly after, the latter hinted that he had squandered the majority of it, but that the information would remain secure with him since he would prefer to “take 20 years” behind bars than expose those who bribed him.</p><p>It was then revealed that the individual was a disguised FBI agent, and Miguel had just admitted to his crimes.</p><p>Miguel Moya was <a href=# rel=noopener>detained on bribery</a>, conspiracy, financial fraud, tampering with evidence, and tax fraud accusations as a result of this. His first trial ended in a hung jury because the defense said he’d been expending old unlawful funds seized by him and his cousin.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>Also See: <a href=#>Attorneys Battle on Netflix’s Cocaine Cowboys Miami – Roy Black & Albert Krieger vs Chris Clark & Pat Sullivan</a></strong></p><p>Despite this, his next trial, which was based on gambling, resulted in a jury sentence. Miguel could face up to 138 years in captivity, but he spent over 20 years — 17 to be precise — in prison.</p><p>Miguel was liberated from the federal penitentiary early on 30th July 2013 and has decided to remain out of the spotlight since.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Blurred Reality</a> for more <a href=#>interesting news</a> of your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKWZnMKmuIymprKZXZi8pK3Ip5xmm5%2Bsr7DF0makopmdnnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-montana-bio-everything-about-joe-montanas-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything About Joe Montana's Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./first-animal-of-the-chinese-zodiac-crossword-clue-la-times-answer-1123976.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>First animal of the Chinese zodiac Crossword Clue LA Times Answer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
