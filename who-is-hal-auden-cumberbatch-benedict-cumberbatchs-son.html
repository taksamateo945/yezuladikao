By birth, Hal Auden is also a British citizen who gets to enjoy all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities one is entitled to.</p><p>Hal Auden was named after the Shakespearean character Henry V who was nicknamed Hal in one of the author’s books about the former English Monarch. He got his middle name Auden from the American poet W.H. Auden and as a tribute to his father’s close friend, Tom Hiddleston.</p><p>For emphasis, Hal Auden Cumberbatch is the son of multiple award-winning actor Benedict Cumberbatch, whom he had with his wife Sophie Hunter.</p><h2><strong>Hal Auden Cumberbatch’s Parents are Prominent Names in Hollywood</strong></h2><p>Hal Auden Cumberbatch’s parents are both prominent figures in the American movie industry. His father was born Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch on July 19, 1976, in the London district of Hammersmith, at Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital to actors Timothy Carlton (full name: Timothy Carlton Congdon Cumberbatch) and Wanda Ventham.</p><p>He was raised in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, alongside a half-sister named Tracy Peacock, who was a product of his mother’s first marriage. He completed his secondary education at Harrow School, and then took a gap year which saw him teaching English at a Tibetan monastery in India.</p><p>Afterward, he then attended the Victoria University of Manchester, where he acquired a degree in drama. He further trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) and obtained an MA in classical acting.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/02/benedict_cumberbatch_sophie_hunter-1.jpg alt="Hal Auden Cumberbatch" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Hal Auden’s father has been active in the movie industry for over two decades now, officially beginning his acting career in 1998. Most of his notable roles include portraying the character Sherlock Holmes in the British mystery crime drama TV series Sherlock from 2010 to 2017.</p><p>His role as Doctor Strange in the Marvel movie of the same name in 2016 set him up as one of Marvel’s superheroes. He has picked up several awards and recognitions for his masterful portrayal of his craft as an actor including a Primetime Emmy Award, an AACTA award, and a British Academy Television Award among several others. He has also been nominated for a lot more.</p><p>Hal Auden Cumberbatch’s mother, Sophie Hunter was born Sophie Irene Hunter, on March 16, 1978, to Anna Katharine née Gow and Charles Rupert. Her parents later divorced but before then, they managed to give her two younger brothers, Timothy and Patrick. She also has two half-siblings named Lily-Rose and Samuel from her father’s second marriage.</p><p>While her showbiz career may not be as prominent as her husband’s, Sophie Hunter is a theatre director, former actress, and singer. She has directed and starred in several theatre, television, and film projects including Hamlet (2005), Mumbai Calling (2007), Macbeth (2008), Torchwood (2009), Enron (2010), and Sleep No More (2011), among others.</p><h2><strong>Hal Auden’s Parents Had Been Married for Two Years at the Time of his Birth</strong></h2><p>Hal Auden Cumberbatch’s parents tied the proverbial knot on Valentine’s day in 2015. Before that, they met each other for the first time in 2009 on the set of the thriller film Burlesque Fairytales. At the time though, Hal’s dad was in the latter stages of his twelve-year-long relationship with actress Olivia Poulet.</p><p>We have yet to ascertain the exact timeline of when Hal’s parents started dating officially but given that Benedict’s relationship with Poulet ended in 2010, one might assume that he and Sophie officially became an item around the same time. Their first public appearance as a couple was at the French Open in June 2014. They announced their engagement in November 2014.</p><p>The classy wedding which had a fair number of celebrity guests in attendance was held at a 12th-century church located on the Isle of Wight. An even classier reception followed immediately at Mottistone Manor.</p><p>The happily married couple have been together for around a dozen years and have maintained their marital status together for the best part of over half a decade, a feat which in itself is an impressive one given the unimpressive ratio of celebrity failed marriages.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/02/Finn-Cumberbatch-2.jpg alt="Hal Auden Cumberbatch" width=696 height=499 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2><strong>Hal Auden Cumberbatch has Two Brothers&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Hal Auden Cumberbatch is not his parents’ only child. For a better perspective, the 6-year-old celebrity kid is his parents’ middle child. He has an older brother named Christopher “Kit” Carlton Cumberbatch, and a younger brother named Finn Cumberbatch.</p><p>Whether by coincidence or as a result of a conscious effort from his parents, there is around a 2-year age difference between Hal Auden and his older brother, and the same timeline separates him from his younger brother.</p><p>For an accurate representation of the aforementioned facts, it is important to point out that Hal’s older brother Christopher was born on June 1, 2015, a few months after their parents’ wedding. His younger brother Finn, on the other hand, was born on January 11, 2019.</p><h2><strong>He Currently Lives Outside The Spotlight</strong></h2><p>While he has undoubtedly made a few public appearances alongside his more illustrious parents, Hal Auden Cumberbatch largely lives his life away from the spotlight. A lifestyle that has been chosen for him by his parents to protect his childhood experiences at the very least.</p><p>Details of his formal educational background are unknown at present but the celebrity kid who currently resides in their exquisite home on the southern fringes of Hampstead Heath is undoubtedly getting a sound formal education.</p><p>Also given his parents’ combined net worth of around $44 million, $40 million on Benedict’s side, and $4 million on Sophie’s end, it is safe to say that Hal Auden Cumberbatch is living a privileged lifestyle that provides the best life has to offer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmagkaF6osHDnqVmm6Wir6a%2BwZqrnKBdl7KvscOimq1lk6q6o7HRm5itm5ioerS7zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./qwabe-twins-life-and-family-of-viggy-and-virginia-the-hamba-singers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Qwabe Twins - Life and Family of Viggy and Virginia the Hamba Singers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./167105-banyana-banyana-keeper-kaylin-swarts-listed-top-keepers-womens-world-cup-mzansi-defends-her.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Banyana Banyana Keeper Kaylin Swarts On List of FIFA's Top Keepers During Womens World Cup: &amp;quot;You</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eamon-virk.html>Adnan Virk's Wife Eamon Virk</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10125646-nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement.html>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-element-of-some-holiday-traditions-crossword-clue-1150416.html>LA Times Element of some holiday traditions Crossword Clue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brenda-warner.html>Brenda Warner</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-overstreet.html>Paul Overstreet</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash.
