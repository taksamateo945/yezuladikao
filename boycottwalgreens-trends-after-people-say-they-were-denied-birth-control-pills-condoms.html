The pharmacist added that the pharmacy had been having issues with women being refused birth control in the past two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>“First they want us to stop getting pregnant and having abortions, and then they don’t want to help us prevent that pregnancy,” Martin said.&nbsp;</p><p>Her video has almost 4 million views as of Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p>The outcry on Twitter comes in the aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion. More than a dozen states have moved to ban or severely restrict abortion access following the the high court’s decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Some activists and lawmakers have also expressed concerns that the overturning of Roe could open the floodgates for other landmark cases to be overturned like&nbsp;Griswold v. Connecticut, which protects access to birth control.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hill has reached out to Walgreens for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>One Twitter user said on Sunday that her coworker <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">relies</a> on the birth control pill for health issues, but Walgreens declined her refill.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>LAX to be first airport to offer Real ID application center</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>New home construction falls to nine-month low</a><br><p>In addition to preventing unwanted pregnancy, the pill can also have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">positive effects</a> for health conditions like iron deficiency, infections and some endometrial and ovarian cancers, according to Planned Parenthood.&nbsp;</p><p>Another Twitter user named Nate Pentz <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a cashier at Walgreens told his wife, Jess, that he would not sell her condoms because of his faith. The cashier offered to bring a manager over.&nbsp;</p><p>Jess filed a complaint with Walgreens, saying the cashier embarrassed her in front of other customers for her personal choice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8eemKWsmGK7psPSaJmosZOkwbXDwKWeq52Vo8BuwNGepZ2rXZaztbHRZqeep6Chsm6%2FwLJkraCVrnq4sdGeZJ2dnp6ypXnBoqmtoF2YvK%2FA0aijZqiZobm0ecKopZ2nnah8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karen-o-pregnant-yeah-yeah-yeahs-singer-first-child-2015194.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karen O Is Pregnant!
